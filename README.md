**Abstract:**
In this position paper, we introduce a concept of personal autonomous intelligence computer~(PAIC), to combine the advantage of two mainstream intelligence systems, connectionism and rule-based symbolism. Similar to a traditional von Neumann architecture, our PAIC consists of the input-output, memory, control, processing, and storage Unit. PAIC not only removes the limitation of the fix-length context window from the large language model but also achieves multi-hop reasoning-related precise manipulation of input with a novel pipeline. We also argue that, with the progressive increase of PAIC users on the Internet, the data flow of the current Internet will be reformed to achieve a decentralized local network.
